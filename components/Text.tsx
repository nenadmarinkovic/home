            In my most recent role, I had the opportunity to work at
            DCCS software company. Here, I contributed to the
            development of a web application for helping residents and
            property owners to have insights into their energy
            consumption. During this project, I acquired extensive
            expertise in constructing adaptable front-end components
            using Vue.js, all within a framework of agile SCRUM
            methodology. This experience further solidified my skills
            in building scalable software solutions.
